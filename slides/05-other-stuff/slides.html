# PERMANOVA

---

# MANOVA

MANOVA is the multivariate form of ANOVA

* Multivariate response data
* Categorical predictor variables

Decompose variation in the responses into

1. variation within groups
2. variation between groups

Test to see if two is unusually large relative to H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

---

# PERMANOVA

Doing that test requires lots of assumptions that rarely hold for ecological data

PERMANOVA: Permutational multivariate analysis of variance

Avoids most of these issues through the use of permutation tests

Directly decomposes a dissimilarity matrix into

1. variation within groups
2. variation between groups

---

# PERMANOVA *sensu stricto*

*vegan* has four different ways to do essentially do this kind of analysis

1. `adonis()` &amp;mdash; implements Anderson (2001)
2. `adonis2()` &amp;mdash; implements McArdle &amp; Anderson (2001)
3. `dbrda()` &amp;mdash; implementation based on McArdle &amp; Anderson (2001)
4. `capscale()` &amp;mdash; implements Legendre &amp; Anderson (1999)

Be careful with `adonis()` as it allows only sequential tests

A difference between the functions is how they treat negative eigenvalues

# The dispersion problem

Anderson (2001) noted that PERMANOVA could confound *location* &amp; *dispersion* effects

If one or more groups are more variable &amp;mdash; dispersed around the centroid &amp;mdash; than the others, this can result in a false detection of a difference of means &amp;mdash; a *location* effect

Same problem affects *t* tests, ANOVA

# Test for dispersion effects

Marti Anderson (2006) developed a test for multivariate dispersions &amp;mdash; PERMDISP2

1. Calculate how far each observation is from its group median (or centroid)
2. Take the absolute values of these distances-to-medians
3. Do an ANOVA on the absolute distances with the *groups* as covariates
4. Test the H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of equal absolute distances to median among groups using a permutation test

In *vegan* this is `betadisper()`

# Test for locations with non-equal dispersion?

# Distance-based RDA

---

# Distance-based RDA

Multiple models that all do something Similar

1. `adonis()` (deprecated)
2. `adonis2()`
3. `capscale()`
4. `dbrda()`

They all do essentially the same thing, but they do it differently &amp; have slightly different behaviour

---

# Distance-based RDA

Distance-based RDA (db-RDA) is a constrained form of principal coordinates analysis (PCO)

It is similar to RDA but allows for non-Euclidean dissimilarity indices

In *vegan*, db-RDA is implemented in `dbrda()`

---

# Constrained analysis of principal coordinates

`capscale()` is *another* constrained form of PCO due to Legendre &amp; Anderson (1999)

It is *very* similar to `dbrda()` but handles the negative eigenvalue problem in a different way &amp;mdash; it ignores them!

---

# Constrained analysis of principal coordinates

`capscale()` works by

1. convert the response data into dissimilarities
2. apply PCO on the dissimilarities, take the PCO sample (site) scores as *new* response data
3. fit `rda()` to the *new* response data and predictor variables as constraints

Essentially, we embed the dissimilarities in a Euclidean space using PCO, and then we use RDA on this highly transformed response data

---

# Distance-based RDA

db-RDA foregoes step 2., and directly decomposes the dissimilarities into components explained by each term in the model

Negative eigenvalues resulting from non-metric dissimilarity coefficients are handled via

1. square-root transform of the dissimilarities, or
2. adding a constant to the dissimilarities using methods `"lingoes"` (default, preferred) or `"cailliez"`

db-RDA is based on the ideas in McArdle &amp; Anderson (2001)

--

Err&amp;hellip; isn't that what `adonis2()` was developed to do?

--

*Yes*, but&amp;hellip;

---

# Distance-based RDA

`adonis2()` was a ground up redevelopment of the `adonis()` implementation and as such it retains many of the arguments and concepts of PERMANOVA, just updated to use the direct decomposition of dissimilarities

`dbrda()` inherits from `rda()` and `cca()` and as a result has expanded set of capability

`dbrda()` can use `Condition()` in the formula to fit partial db-RDA

`Condition()` is often needed to provide correct restricted perumtation tests

---

# Distance-based RDA

The equivalent model to `adonis2()` in `dbrda()`-form is


```r
data(dune, dune.env)
dune_dbrda &lt;- dbrda(dune ~ Management * A1, data = dune.env,
    method = "bray")
```

because they have different default `method` values

# High-throughput data

Revolutions in biology &amp; biotechnology have lead to exponential increases in our capacity to generate data arising from the counting of biological molecules

* DNA sequencing,
* RNA-Seq &amp;mdash; sequence RNA molecules in populations of cells or tissues,
* ChIp-Seq &amp;mdash; sequence DNA molecules that are bound to particular proteins,
* &amp;hellip;

Relative cheaply, today we can generate data sets with thousands of variables on tens to hundreds of samples

---

# High-throughput data

Counts of such molecules present a statistical challenge

* the counts typically have a large *dynamic range*, covering many orders of magnitudes

* over this very large range we observe changes in both variance (spread about the mean) and also in distribution of the data &amp;mdash; **heterogeneity**

* like other count data, observations are integers and distributions are skewed

* the biotech methodology imparts systematic sampling biases into the data that we need to account for in an analysis &amp;mdash; typically called **normalization** in this sub-field

---

# Sequence depth &amp; size factors

The number of reads for each sample is a kind of *effort* variable

All else equal, the more reads we generate the more species (OTUs, ASVs, etc) we would expect to identify

If number of reads differs between samples (libraries) then, all else equal we might assume the counts in different samples are proportional to one another, following some proportionality factor `\(s\)`

A simple estimate for `\(s\)` might be the total reads per sample

But we can do better than this &amp;hellip;

# Variance stabilizing transformations

The square-root transformation is known as the _variance stabilizing transformation_ for the Poisson distribution

Taking the square root of observations that are distributed Poisson leads to *homoscedasticity*

Can construct variance stabilizing transformations for other distributions

High-throughput count data typically show extra-Poisson variation

`DESeq2::varianceStabilizingTransformation()`

---

# Regularized log transform

This transforms counts to a log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like scale via a simple model

`$$\log_2(q_{ij}) = \sum_k x_{jk} \beta_{ik}$$`

where `\(q_{ij}\)` are the transformed data and `\(x_{jk}\)` is a particular design matrix with a dummy variable for the `\(j\)`th sample for ($i = {1, 2, \dots m}$ variables)

Priors on the `\(\beta_{ik}\)` make the model identifiable

The _rlog_ transformation is ~ variance stabilizing, but handles highly varying size factors across samples

Figure 8.12: Per-gene standard deviation (sd, taken across samples) against the rank of the mean, for the shifted logarithm , the variance-stabilizing transformation (vst) and the rlog. Note that for the leftmost  2,500 genes, the counts are all zero, and hence their standard deviation is zero. The mean-sd dependence becomes more interesting for genes with non-zero counts. Note also the high value of the standard deviation for genes that are weakly detected (but not with all zero counts) when the shifted logarithm is used, and compare to the relatively flat shape of the mean-sd relationship for the variance-stabilizing transformation.

---

# Implications

Size factors can be used in GLMs etc to normalize samples via as `offset()` term in the formula

For ordination we can't easily use the size factors

Need to use _vst_ or _rlog_ instead

_rlog_ creates data that can't be used in CCA, so if you use it, RDA or db-RDA are the ordination methods to use

# mvabund

The _mvabund_ package implements this kind of model

Testing is done using resampling (parametric bootstrap)

Resampling *rows* of data allows the model to handle the _multivariate_ property of the data, that counts are correlated across taxa

`manyglm()` implements the model

Data from a study looking at the effect of revegetation on invertebrate communities (data from Anthony Pik, Macquarie University). Invertebrates were sampled in 4-5 pitfall traps at eight sites that had undergone revegetation, and two sites that hadn't, and it was of interest to see what the effect of revegetation was on the invertebrate community.

# Dimension reduction

Typically we can't model all 100+ taxa in data sets like this

* (M)ARSS-like models don't like the large `\(n\)`

Seek a reduced dimensionality of the data that preserves the signal

Existing dimension reduction methods aren't appropriate for questions we want to ask

* Interpretation of latent factors is complex (PCA, CA, Principal Curves)

Can we group species into `\(J\)` **associations** and soft cluster samples as compositions of these associations?

What are the proportion of flavours in each pack?

How many of each pack comprise the skittle community?

# Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Aim is to infer the 

- distribution of skittle **flavours** within each pack `\(\beta_j\)`, and
- distribution of skittle **packs** within each community (*sample*)

Achieve a soft clustering of samples &amp;mdash; mixed membership model

Achieve a soft clustering of **species** (flavours) into **associations** of taxa (packs)

User supplies `\(J\)` &amp;mdash; the number of associations *a priori* &amp;mdash; `\(j = \{1, 2, \dots, J\}\)`

`\(J\)` chosen using AIC, *perplexity*, CV, &amp;hellip;

---

# Latent Dirichlet Allocation

1. Flavour distribution for `\(j\)`th type of Skittle
    `$$\beta_j \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\delta)$$`

2. Proportions of each type in the Skittle community
    `$$\theta \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\alpha)$$`

---

# Latent Dirichlet Allocation

3. For each skittle `\(s_i\)`
    * Choose a pack in proportion
      `$$z_i \sim \text{Multinomial}(\theta)$$`
    * Choose a flavour from chosen pack with probability
	  `$$p(s_i | z_i, \beta_j) \sim \text{Multinomial}(\delta)$$`

---

# Correlated Topic Model

LDA assumes associations of species are **uncorrelated**

More *parsimonious* &amp; *realistic* if associations were correlated

* Proportions of each type in the Skittle community &amp;mdash; draw

    `$$\eta \sim N(\mu, \Sigma)$$`
	
	with `\(\eta \in \mathbb{R}^{J-1}\)` and `\(\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{(J-1) \times (J-1)}\)`
	
	Then transform `\(\eta_J\)` to proportional scale

`\(\Sigma\)` controls the correlation between *associations*

# LDA | Trend estimation

LDA knows nothing about the temporal ordering of the samples

Estimate trends in proportions of species associations using a GAM

Other methods would also be appropriate: eg. Bayesian change point model or Dirichlet regression

# Intuition behind LDA

Latent Dirichlet allocation represents a trade-off between two goals

1. for each sample, allocate its individuals to a **few associations of species**
2. in each association, assign high probability to a **few species**

---

# Intuition behind LDA

These are in opposition

* assigning a sample to a single association makes *2* **hard** &amp;mdash; all its species must have high probability under that one topic
* putting very few species in each association makes *1* **hard** &amp;mdash; to cover all individuals in a sample must assign sample to many associations

Trading off these two goals therefore results in LDA finding tightly co-occurring species

# Summary

LDA &amp; CTM proved well-capable of summarizing the complex community dynamics of Foy Lake

* Reduced 113 taxa to 10 associations of species
* Species associations match closely the expert interpretation of the record
    * make autecological sense also
* The CTM was more parsimonious &amp;mdash; removed one rare association
* Estimated trends in proportions of species associations capture mixture of
    * smooth, slowly varying trends, and
	* rapid (regime shift?) state change ~ 1.3 ky BP
